Do
you
have
to?Ned.
Ten
is
too
young
to
see
such
things.All
these
years
and
I
still
feel
like
an
outsider
when
I
come
here.I
wonder
if
the
old
gods
agree.I
am
so
sorry,
my
love.Gods,
but
they
grow
fast.How
many
times
have
I
told
you
No
climbing!I
want
you
to
promise
me.
No
more
climbing.Your
Grace.My
queen.
