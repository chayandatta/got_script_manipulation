But
who
would
he
tell?If
he
told
the
king,
both
our
heads
would
be
skewered
on
the
city
gates
by
now.
Whatever
Jon
Arryn
knew
or
didn’t
know,
it
died
with
him.
And
Robert
will
choose
a
new
Hand
of
the
king,
someone
to
do
his
job
while
he’s
off
fucking
boars
and
hunting
whores.
Or
is
it
the
other
way
around?
And
life
will
go
on.That’s
an
honor
I
can
do
without.
Their
days
are
too
long,
their
lives
are
too
short.
