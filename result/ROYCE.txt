Do
the
dead
frighten
you?You
don’t
think
he’ll
ask
us
how
they
died?
Get
back
on
your
horse.It’s
a
good
thing
we’re
not
children.
You
want
to
run
away
south,
run
away.
Of
course,
they
will
behead
you
as
a
deserter
…
If
I
don’t
catch
you
first.
Get
back
on
your
horse.
I
won’t
say
it
again.Your
dead
men
seem
to
have
moved
camp.What
is
it?
